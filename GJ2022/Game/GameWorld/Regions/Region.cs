    /// Region system:
    /// ========
    /// 
    /// A region determines a section of the world in which all points are accessible to each other.
    /// 
    /// The world will be broken down into 8x8 chunks and each one designated regions.
    /// If there is non passable turfs within any of the 8x8 chunks that split the region into pieces, then many regions can be generated for 1 of these.
    /// 
    /// Region Rules:
    /// =========
    ///  - For each point within a region, there must exist a valid path between those 2 points without leaving that region
    ///  - A region shares at least 1 superparent with any region that can be accessed by it.
    ///  - Regions can be only children as long as they have a parent up high enough that has 2 children.
    ///  
    /// Region Properties:
    /// =========
    ///  - Checking if a valid path exists between 2 points can be done by getting the regions of the 2 points and seeing if they have a shared super-parent.
    ///  
    /// Region Functionality:
    /// =========
    /// When a new region is created we need to create parent regions if neccessary.
    /// To do this, we need to locate any regions that we are attached to directly.
    /// We then need to calculate the level of our shared parent.
    /// We then traverse up both trees until we hit the top level, or the level of the shared parent.
    /// We then create parents where necessary until we hit the shared parent.
    /// Both nodes should now have the same superparent
